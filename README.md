### Overview 

Responsive web design, originally defined by [Ethan Marcotte in A List Apart,](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/) responds to the needs of the users and the devices they're using.  
The layout changes based on the size and capabilities of the device. For example, on a phone users would see content shown in a single column view;  
a tablet might show the same content in two columns.
